* Run `mix phx.server`
* Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000)
* Reload the browser.

<!-- Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser. -->

<!-- Ready to run /in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix -->

## Working

* Implemented the distributed protocol.
* Simulated bitcoin for 100 nodes.
* Time taken to mine each block.
* Transaction amount in each block.
* Statistics on the total bitcoin gained by mining.
* Total amount of bitcoin transacted till now. (Transactions are random)

## Test cases

* Verfied if the user has a balance greater than the amount he wants to send.
* Verified if the balance changes if the person with invalid balance sends bitcoin.
* Validating the hashes generated by miners, if they have the stipulated number of zeros.
* Simulated the protocol for different difficulties (1-4).
* Checked the balance after sending money from one person to other.
* Simulated the protocol for different number of users (10 -150).
* Flagging the invalid transactions.
* Show in the web interface, if the transaction amount is 0.
* Show in the web interface, total bitcoin transacted remains zero if there is invalid transaction.
* Mining incentive for the person with the appropriate hash.
